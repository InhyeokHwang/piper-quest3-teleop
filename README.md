## Acknowledgement

This project was developed by referencing and extending the ideas and codebase from **OpenTeleVision**, a VR-based teleoperation framework for robotic manipulation.

## Future Work

The following improvements and extensions are planned for future development:

- **Improving IK convergence stability**  
  Address convergence failures in inverse kinematics, particularly under singular or unfavorable joint configurations, to ensure smoother and more reliable teleoperation.

- **Gripper activation via Quest3 controller input**  
  Enable intuitive gripper open/close control using Meta Quest 3 controller buttons or gestures.

- **Robot joint visualization in Quest3**  
  Add real-time visualization of the robot arm’s joint positions within the Quest environment to improve operator awareness and control precision.

- **Motion preference and posture biasing**  
  Introduce joint preference or posture biasing mechanisms to encourage natural, stable, and task-consistent robot arm configurations during teleoperation.
